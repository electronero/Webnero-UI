# Install (one-liner)

  The sym linked `*.html` files located in `./` will be hot loaded to `wallet/*` and you can serve the `*.html` directly from `./`
  
# Install (walk-through)
## Building from Source Files
  
  After cloning the repo take a look at the `gulpfile.js` and check out the tasks available:
* `gulp less` The less task will compile the LESS into the `dist` directory and minify the output.
* `gulp deploy` The default task will compile templates from NJK to HTML, and LESS and JS, then output into the `dist` directory and minify the output, and it will copy all vendor libraries from `bower_components`
